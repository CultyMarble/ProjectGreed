  - 'You: Who am I? Well, I.. I don''t know, actually..'
  - 'You: Who are you? Are you actually.. A Cat?'
  - 'Barrel Cat: Whaddya mean you don''t know who you are? How did you even get here?'

  - 'Barrel Cat: ...'
  - 'You: I dunno.'
  - 'Barrel Cat: Figures.'
  - 'Barrel Cat: Well anyways, I''m Timothy. Nice to meet''cha. '
  - 'Timothy: I gotta ask.. Whats the deal with your head? Is that a mushroom?'
  - 'You: My head? Oh... I hadn''t noticed that.. I guess it is.'
  - 'Timothy: You sure are a weird one...'
  - 'You: You''re the talking cat!'
  - 'Timothy: You''re the one talkin to the cat. Weirdo.'
  - 'You: What is this place? I''m really not sure how I got here. Or anything else
    for that matter.'
  - 'Timothy: You''re on the outskirts of the city of GOLD in the once great Kingdom
    of GOLD. Emphasis on the "once". It is not so much anymore.'
  - 'You: What happened?'
  - 'Timothy: The curse of course. The king''s greed caused the kingdom to be cursed.
    It affects nearly everyone, warping their minds and their memories. Now the king
    just hides in the castle while everyone suffers.'
  - 'You: Can I help?'
  - 'Timothy: Taking out the gravekeeper surely couldn''t hurt.'
  - 'Timothy: Keep heading forward and you''ll get to his crypt. He''s somewhere
    deep within it'
  - 'You: Alright, I''ll head there now. Thanks.'
  - 'Timothy: See you later!'
